"# Malaria Outbreak Risk Prediction - (Good Health and Well Being)." 

Capstone Project Idea Proposal

1. Project Idea

This project will develop a model to predict malaria outbreak risks in specific regions using past health data, weather records, and environmental factors. The aim is to identify high-risk areas in advance so health workers can respond early and reduce the spread.

2. Relevance to SDGs

The idea supports SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being by helping to prevent malaria, which causes many deaths in developing countries. It also connects to SDG 1 – No Poverty by lowering the financial and economic impact malaria has on families and communities.

3. Literature Examples

    Nababan et al. (2021) built a malaria outbreak prediction model in Indonesia using weather and case data with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

    Nguyen et al. (2020) predicted malaria outbreaks in Southeast Asia using climate data like rainfall, humidity, and temperature, achieving strong accuracy.

4. Describe Your Data

I will use data from the WHO Global Health Observatory for malaria cases, and NASA POWER/NOAA for weather data. Files will be in CSV format. Data cleaning, handling missing values, and combining datasets by date and location will be done before modeling.

5. Approach

I will use Machine Learning because the data is structured and suitable for algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost. These models are interpretable and can show which factors contribute most to malaria outbreaks.
